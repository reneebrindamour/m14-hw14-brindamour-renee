I have used Bootstrap in the past, so it wasn't a new concept for me. The biggest challenge for me in this assignment was trying not to use a lot of custom CSS, and I paid extra attention to that requirement. While using Bootstrap, I noticed that it defaulted to the blue color scheme. To personalize the design, I used CSS to change the font and color. I also added a few transitions to the navbar and button upon hover. This decision was a judgment call, and I hope it doesn't negatively affect my grade. Although I could have left out these customizations, I felt that they made the page look more cohesive and polished.
